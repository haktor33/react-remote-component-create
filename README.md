# Remote Component Starter

Create your custom component under the components folder

## Getting Started

Clone the repository and initialize your project

```bash

# create new repo

mkdir my-component
cd my-component
git init

# pull the remote component starter

git pull https://

# install dependencies

npm i

## Files

There are a few important files, one set is used for the bundle, another set for local development.

- `src/index.js` - Entrypoint of the Remote Component. The component needs to be the `default` export.
- `src/webpack-dev-server.js` - Entrypoint for `webpack-dev-server`. This is only used for development and will not be included in the final bundle.
- `src/index.html` - HTML for `webpack-dev-server`. This is only used for development and will not be included in the final bundle.

## Building

The bundle will be output to the `dist/custom.js`.

```bash
npm run build
```

Create a development build for easier debugging.

```bash
npm run build:dev
```

## Debugging

The component can be debugged locally by first starting `webpack-dev-server`.

```bash
npm run start
```

Now (using VSCODE), go to the Debug tab, select "Launch Chrome" and start the debugger (F5).

You should now be able to set breakpoints and step through the code.

## Changing the Output

The bundle as a default will be output to the `dist/main.js`. This can be updated by changing the following two files:

1. `entry` in `webpack-main.config.js`. Update the `main` property to a desired output name.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  ...
  entry: {
    custom1: "./src/components/custom1.js",
    custom2: "./src/components/custom2.js"
  },
  ...
};
```

2.  `url` variable in `src/webpac-dev-server.js`

```javascript
// different paths for localhost vs s3
const url =
  global.location.hostname === "localhost" ? "/dist/main.js" : "main.js";
```

## Commiting

Commits are added to the repository with commitizen compatible `git-cz`.

```bash

# stage all changes

git add .

# run commitizen

npm run cz
```
